What's this paper for:
Provide a framewok .
to sovle LLP problem
Empirical Proportion Risk Minimization prove LLP problem can be solved



LLP ~= 
Can we learn label from labeld propoion, Ther leaerner is not learning true lable, insted of learning 
proportion generation function
Like voting, 
You can only know final result, 

Voting Example
in given location , the sample are selectd randomly


bag size 
bag propostion

R is risk
L -> loss function
